         <abstract>The National Land Cover Database 2001 Percent Developed Imperviousness was produced through a cooperative project conducted by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium. The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of federal agencies (www.mrlc.gov), consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture - Forest Service (USDA-FS),
            the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). One of the primary goals of the project is to generate a current, consistent, seamless, and accurate National Land Cover Database (NLCD) circa 2001 for the United States at medium spatial resolution. For a detailed definition and discussion on MRLC and the NLCD 2001 products, refer to Homer et al. (2003) and
            http://www.mrlc.gov/mrlc2k.asp. The NLCD 2001 was created by partitioning the U.S. into mapping zones. A total of 66 mapping zones were delineated within the conterminous U.S. based on ecoregion and geographical characteristics, edge-matching features and the size requirement of Landsat mosaics. This update represents a seamless assembly of updated NLCD 2001 Percent Developed Imperviousness for all 66 MRLC mapping zones. Questions about the NLCD 2001 Percent Developed Imperviousness
            2011 Edition can be directed to the NLCD 2001 land cover mapping team at USGS EROS, Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov.</abstract>

         <attraccr>The information on data quality for NLCD 2001 Percent Developed Imperviousness 2011 Edition seamless data product was generated by the Regression Tree algorithm that conducts a cross-validation for assessing classification and prediction reliability. No formal independent accuracy assessment for this product has been made. The regression tree algorithm employed in NLCD 2001 mapping protocols offers a cross-validation option for assessing classification and prediction
            reliability. Cross-validation can provide relatively reliable estimates for imperviousness predictions if the reference data used for cross-validation are collected based on a statistically valid sampling design. For each mapping zone, a 5-fold cross-validation was conducted by dividing the entire training data set into 5 subsets of equal size. For each model run, an accuracy estimate was derived using one subset to evaluate the model prediction (with the model developed using the
            remaining training samples). This process was repeated 5 times. After all 5 runs, an average value of all accuracy estimates from the 5 runs was computed. Users should be cautioned that these cross-validation results provide users with only first-order estimates of data quality, and should not be considered a formal accuracy assessment.</attraccr>

            <procdesc>To develop adequate training data for impervious estimation, approximately 20 DOQQ's across each mapping zone with a nominal spatial resolution of 1-m were classified into either pervious or non-pervious surfaces, and then summed within each 30 meter Landsat pixel cell to obtain percentage of imperviousness. Training data were selected based on the degree of variance each training data set possesses with regards to Landsat ETM+ imagery used for mapping. Each added training
               data set decreased the amount of variance present within the Landsat data as a whole. The selection process was repeated until the amount of variance explained reached a pre-defined threshold. By combining the training data with Landsat spectral data and other ancillary data, percent imperviousness prediction models were developed using a regression tree algorithm (named "Cubist"). All data layers used as input for running the Cubist, in order to establish the prediction model for
               imperviousness are listed in the "Supplemental Information" section. Three ancillary data sets were used for urban/suburban delineation masking, which is essential to confine the imperviousness mapping within the developed areas. After the best combination of possible input data layers had been determined and the final percent impervious layer produced, the urban mask created was used to eliminate those pixels from the final percent impervious file that fall outside identified
               impervious surface areas. Thus, the impervious pixels identified within the mask were retained, while all non-impervious surface pixels were removed from the final product. This corrected for any small areas of pixels that may have been included as part of the impervious surface layer because their spectral signature was not covered in the Cubist modeling process. Finally, visual inspection of imperviousness layer was made with limited manual editing to eliminate non-urban areas
               based on area of interest delineated by the mapping team. For Landsat Scene Acquisition dates and identification numbers for imagery used in the NLCD 2001 land, please see: appendix2_nlcd2001_scene_list_by_zone.txt</procdesc>

            <procdesc>NLCD 2001 Impervious (2011 Edition) Processing To improve NLCD imperviousness the 2011 project included a process to reduce omission and commission error in NLCD 2001, 2006, and 2011 products. This activity was completed for urban areas in most of the eastern ½ of the conterminous United States. High resolution (one-meter ground sample distance) National Aerial Imagery Program (NAIP &#x96; http://fsa.usda.gov/FSA/) imagery was used to verify imperviousness. Using hand-edits
               imperviousness was removed from areas incorrectly identified as developed and added to areas where developed land cover was missed. A modeling process was implemented to parse imperviousness changes to the correct era. These improvements were incorporated with the derived developed classes in all areas of imperviousness and land cover versions released with NLCD 2011 editions.</procdesc>

            <procdesc>Process Step for NLCD 2001 Percent Developed Imperviousness (2011 edition, amended 2014): The release in 2014 of amended versions of Imperviousness for 2001, 2006, and 2011 was made to correct for unintended differences between the impervious dataset and the four land cover developed classes (Open Space, Low Intensity, Medium Intensity, and High Intensity). NLCD developed classes are tied directly to the impervious product values. However, the land cover product Minimum
               Mapping Unit (MMU) is five pixels whereas the impervious product MMU is single pixel. This MMU difference creates problems when the impervious single pixel MMU product is directly crosswalked into the 5-pixel MMU land cover developed classes. The smoothing process, which generalizes the land cover product to a 5-pixel MMU, can create small areas which are no longer directly represented in the imperviousness product because they are artifacts of the smoothing. Since these changes
               are not real and not present in the impervious layer, the new version removes these artifacts and re-establishes the direct linkage between the imperviousness and land cover products for any developed area. Combined developed areas (all developed classes combined into a group) in the land cover product must still meet the 5-pixel MMU threshold; however, the four NLCD land cover individual developed classes within the group patch are now represented by a single pixel MMU to retain
               the direct linkage to the imperviousness product.</procdesc>
