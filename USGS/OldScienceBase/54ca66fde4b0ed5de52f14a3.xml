         <abstract>The Space Acquired Photography includes imagery from the Shuttle Large Format Camera, Skylab, and Gemini missions. The Space Acquired archive contains black-and-white, color, and color-infrared films. </abstract>
         <purpose>Space Acquired photography is collected for various government projects. It also serves as a valuable research tool for the scientific community and general public.</purpose>
         <supplinf>The Large Format Camera (LFC) payload consisted of a camera system mounted inside the shuttle cargo bay. The film magazine was preloaded with 2400 frames of five different types of 9-by-18-inch high definition film (CIR, natural color, and three types of B/W film). The LFC weighed over 3400 pounds and was operated by NASA Johnson Space Center personnel. Mission 41-G lasted only nine days, but over 2000 frames of photography were acquired during the mission. The Gemini
            collection includes historical photography such as the first space walk by an America astronaut, the first docking of two space vehicles, and the first photograph of a solar eclipse from space. Hand-held cameras were used to obtain photographs of geologic, oceanic, and meteorologic targets. The Gemini archive contains 70 mm B/W, color, and CIR films. The Skylab photographs were obtained with earth terrain, multispectral, and hand-held cameras from three manned flights in an
            equatorial orbit 434 kilometers (270 miles) above the Earth. Various films were used in the camera including B/W, B/W-infrared, color, and CIR. The images covered a number of NASA pre-selected test sites. </supplinf>

      <attracc>
         <attraccr>Radiometry is verified by visual inspection of the photo image. Slight systematic radiometric differences may exist between adjacent files; these are due primarily to differences in source image capture dates and sun angles along flight lines. These differences can be observed in an image's general lightness or darkness when it is compared to adjacent file coverages. Tonal balancing may be performed over a group of images during a mosaicing process which may serve to lighten
            or darken adjacent images to improve their tone.</attraccr>

            <procdesc>These imagery were obtained from either astronaut hand-held or spacecraft mounted camera systems. Space readied systems included the Hasselblad 70mm and Linhof AeroTechnicka 127mm cameras. The film images are annotated with mission code, roll and frame number. Ephemeris data are used to index the imagery by calculating the nominal geographic position of the spacecraft when the images are taken. Consequently, if the camera is pointed toward Earth, the calculated nadir point
               of the spacecraft will be very close to the geographical center of the image. </procdesc>
