         <abstract>The 2010 North American Land Cover data set was produced as part of the North American Land Change Monitoring System (NALCMS), a trilateral effort between the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing, the United States Geological Survey, and three Mexican organizations including the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (Instituto Nacional de Estadistica y Geografia), National Commission for the Knowledge and Use of the Biodiversity (Comisión Nacional Para el Conocimiento y
            Uso de la Biodiversidad), and the National Forestry Commission of Mexico (Comisión Nacional Forestal). The collaboration is facilitated by the Commission for Environmental Cooperation, an international organization created by the Canada, Mexico, and United States governments under the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation to promote environmental collaboration between the three countries. The general objective of NALCMS is to devise, through collective effort, a
            harmonized multi-scale land cover monitoring approach which ensures high accuracy and consistency in monitoring land cover changes at the North American scale and which meets each country&#x92;s specific requirements. The initial data set of North American Land Cover at 250 meters reflected land cover information for 2005. This 2010 data set was produced by updating the 2005 data to show land cover changes as determined from more recent data. No changes were mapped in Hawaii because
            newer data were not available. Land cover classification changed between 2005 and 2010 for approximately 1 percent of the continental area. For the continental data sets (including surrounding water fringe) 4150241 pixels (1.03% of the area) changed in the update. The following national counts exclude the water fringe: Canada, 3264779 pixels changed (2.05%); Mexico, 47070 pixels changed (0.15%), and U.S., 836706 pixels changed (0.55%). The initial data set used to generate land cover
            information over North America was produced by the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing from observations acquired by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS/Terra). All seven land spectral bands were processed from Level 1 granules into top-of-atmosphere reflectance covering North America at a 250-meter spatial and 10-day temporal resolution. In order to generate a seamless and consistent land cover map of North America, national maps were generated for Canada by the
            CCRS; for Mexico by INEGI, CONABIO, and CONAFOR; and for the United States by the USGS. Each country used specific training data and land cover mapping methodologies to create national data sets. This North America data set was produced by combining the national land cover data sets. The countries worked together to produce a definitive list of land cover classifications for the 2005 data; the same classifications were used for the 2010 data. This document is available for download
            from the same site as the data and is entitled: North American Land Cover Classifications (2005).</abstract>
         <purpose>Information on land cover across North America provided by this data set is valuable for a range of audiences, including international organizations such as the United Nations Environment Programme, nongovernmental conservation organizations, land managers, and scientific researchers. The continental scale land cover data generated under NALCMS can be used to address issues such as climate change, carbon sequestration, biodiversity loss, and changes in ecosystem structure and
            function, by helping users to better understand the dynamics and continental-scale patterns of North America&#x92;s changing environment. The North American Atlas data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national and continental level. These data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:10,000,000-scale data. No responsibility is assumed by Natural Resources Canada, Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía, the U.S. Geological Survey, or
            the Commission for Environmental Cooperation in the use of these data.</purpose>
         <supplinf>The standard distribution formats for this data set are listed below. Users interested in receiving the data as a GRID or BIN file may contact the CEC. Land cover monitoring, the goal of the NALCMS project, requires multiple land cover maps, ideally at annual intervals. It has been shown that post-classification change detection, i.e. the comparison of two land cover maps, does not yield satisfying results because it highly overestimates changes. Therefore, the NALCMS builds
            upon a two-step approach that 1) estimates the change between two sample years, also called maximum potential change, and 2) updates the classification of only those pixels that were identified as potential change. This process ensures that changes in classification will only focus on areas where a previous algorithm detected the potential for change and the remainder of the map remains without modifications.

            <procdesc>A series of monthly MODIS composites were produced prior to the compilation of land cover data for each country. Input data used in land cover mapping were generated from the following original Level 1B MODIS data (collection 5): a) MOD02QKM - Level 1B 250m swath data, 5-min Granules; b) MOD02HKM - Level 1B 500m swath data, 5-min granules; c) MOD03 &#x96; Level 1 Geolocation information, 1km swath data, 5-min granules. All input data are available from the NASA Level 1 and
               Atmosphere Archive and Distribution System (LAADS), http://ladsweb.nascom.nasa.gov/ The MODIS 500m land channels (B3-B7) were downscaled to 250m spatial resolution as described by Trishchenko et al. (2006) and then re-projected into Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area projection using software developed at the CCRS (Khlopenkov et al., 2008). Two original 250m MODIS channels and five downscaled 250m MODIS land channels were assembled into North-America-wide 1 10-day composites following
               the methods developed in Luo et al., (2008). MODIS 10-day composites were further processed to reduce data noise due to different viewing conditions and remaining cloud and atmosphere contamination. A temporal rank filter was applied, calculated as the maximum of minimum values for two overlapping moving windows. For this implementation, a window size of three ten-day composites was used with one pixel overlap between windows. After rank filtering, a procedure to detect residual
               spikes in the data was applied based on a neighbourhood comparison. Within a moving window of 3 composites, if the neighbouring pixels were both above or below the centre pixel by 25%, the centre pixel was linearly interpolated from its neighbours. The filtered 10-day composites were averaged to generate monthly composites. The processed data set contained 12 monthly composites of channels 1 (B1, VIS) and 2 (B2, near-infrared NIR) at 250m spatial resolution and five channels
               designed for land applications (bands B3 to B7) resampled to 250m spatial resolution.</procdesc>

            <procdesc>Version 2 of the 2005 Land Cover was used as the starting point for all three countries. Areas of potential change were identified and then reclassified as necessary. Country-specific processes are described in this process step and the ones below. Please see the points-of-contact if additional processing information is needed. For Canada, the 2010 land cover was derived from a time series of land cover, developed for Canada from 2000 to 2010 at an annual time step, using
               MODIS data as input (Pouliot et al., 2013). The method used to update land cover for each year in the time series followed a change- and evidence-based classification approach. It was applied separately for six mapping zones. Mapping zones were selected to have similar spectral and land cover properties that could be optimized within the zone so as to reduce class confusion. Change detection was a critical step, as the basic premise of the method required changes to be detected
               with high confidence. Three methods were used to capture different types of change and at different temporal scales. Annual negative change results were generated in previous research by Guindon et al. (2011), which mostly captured forest-stand-replacing disturbances such as harvesting and fire. New methods were developed to capture annual positive change in disturbed areas and to account for subtle multi-year change of either a negative or positive nature. Negative change refers
               to vegetation loss and positive change to vegetation establishment and growth. In the context of multi-year change, examples of the negative case include recurrent insect defoliation, gradual urbanization, and persistent climatic or hydrological alteration. For the positive case, examples include gradual regeneration of disturbed areas and climate-related vegetation change. To predict the new land cover label for a change area, several sources of evidence were combined including
               the class membership output from a decision tree classifier, class temporal transition likelihood, and regional and neighbourhood class proportions. The class with the maximum combined evidence was taken as the updated land cover label. A base land cover map for 2005 was used for the update and served as the classification training data source. To capture class temporal variability, training samples were taken for pixels that had not changed within plus or minus 1 year of the base
               map. Temporal filtering of the time series was the final step applied to remove highly improbable land cover transitions once all maps in the time series were processed. Several sources of ancillary data were incorporated in the classification to develop or refine the initial base map. These included a 250-meter spatial resolution water fraction map assembled from the National Topographic Data Base at 1:2500000 scale (Palvic and Latifovic, 2007), digital elevation data at 1:50000
               scale, Canada road network data at 1:250000 scale converted to road density within a 250 meter grid cell, and an indicator of the Taiga class likelihood based on proximity to the northern treeline (Timoney et al., 1992) and conifer class density measured within a 50x50 pixel window of the 2005 land cover base map. Exponentially decreasing membership functions were defined for the distance and density layers and multiplied to calculate the final Taiga likelihood
               estimate.</procdesc>

            <procdesc>In Mexico, potential change estimation built on the monthly MODIS image composites of all seven spectral bands. Image data from 2010 were normalized to the corresponding band and month from 2005 using Theil-Sen regression (Olthof et al. 2005). Next, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was calculated. Based on the NDVI, textural Laplace and Sobel filters with 3x3 kernel size were applied to enhance change detection along land cover edges. In total a set of 120
               data layers were used: data for 7 spectral bands, NDVI, Sobel, and Laplace filters (10 data layers), for 12 months of the year. This set of data layers was produced for both 2005 and 2010, and compared between the two subject years. A small difference in values between the 2005 and 2010 data indicates areas that have not changed, whereas extreme negative and positive values indicate changes. For areas of change, the most appropriate lower and upper cut-off thresholds in the
               difference image histogram (lower and upper quantile) must be determined, and also the frequency, i.e. number of times, out of the 120 data layers used for comparison, that a pixel should be flagged as changed. The appropriate threshold values for the lower quantile, upper quantile, and frequency were defined by training an algorithm using pairs of Landsat images from April (the end of the dry season) and October (the end of the rainy season) for 2005 and 2010, from which change
               was estimated by visual interpretation. The optimal thresholds were defined as: lower quantile, 1 percent; upper quantile, 99 percent; and frequency (the number of data layers indicating change), 30. The resulting change mask identified areas of potential change; errors remaining in the change mask were removed by manual editing. The mask was assessed with 10m SPOT 5 HRG images for nine sites; the overall accuracy was 80 percent, with a commission error rate of 20 percent and a
               omission error rate of 50 percent. Map updating employs the above-described change mask, the baseline version 2 land cover map from 2005, and spectral data from the year 2010. Updating builds on the assumption that all pixels that were not identified as potential change will indicate no change between 2005 and 2010. For each class, 1,500 samples were selected from unchanged areas within 1-2 km of potential areas of change; those samples were used to train the decision tree model
               which was then applied to classify areas of change within the potential change mask area for the year 2010.</procdesc>

            <procdesc>In the United States, land cover for 2010 was mapped by first running a spectral change analysis model to identify areas that potentially had changed between 2005 and 2010. Included in the model were burn areas from MTBS, with an effort made to model burn severity and potential recovery. Only fires from 2010 and earlier were considered in the modeling. Areas of potential change were classified through a process similar to that used to classify the 2005 data, using a
               combination of MODIS composite imagery and ancillary data. Adjustments to the model were made based on experience gained in producing the 2005 Version 2 data set. Classification was achieved by use of a classification and decision tree method (DT). The specific DT program employed is called SEE5, which implements a gain ratio criterion in tree development and pruning (Quinlan, 1993). SEE5 also implemented several advanced features that can aid and improve land cover
               classification, including boosting and cross-validation. Boosting is a technique for improving classification accuracy, while cross-validation can provide a certain level of estimation regarding the land cover classification quality. In addition, SEE5 can generate a confidence estimate for each classified pixel and record the associated classification logic in a text file that can be readily interpreted and incorporated into a metadata system. To conduct the land cover
               classification using DT, a large quantity of training data was required. The change pixels represent a conservative estimate of change based on both spectral analysis and thematic change between land cover modeled for both 2005 and 2010.  Much of the change is in fire perimeter areas.  Burned areas were reclassified as necessary, based on the length of time since the fire occurred. Alaska was processed separately from the conterminous United States, using DEM, SRTM,   and CADEM.
               The conterminous United States was processed using DEM elevation data.  Hawaii was not updated because newer data were not available. The resulting data set was checked against Landsat MRLC for quality assurance.</procdesc>
