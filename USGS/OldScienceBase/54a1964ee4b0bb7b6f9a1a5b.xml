         <abstract>This data set replaces the 2010 edition (Edition 1.0) of the 2005 Land Cover of North America. Following the release of the first 2005 land cover data, several errors were identified in the data, including both errors in labeling and misinterpretation of thematic classes. To correct the labeling errors, each country focused on its national territory and corrected the errors which it considered most critical or misleading. For the continental data sets (including surrounding
            water fringe) 17440830 pixels (4.33% of the area) changed in the update. The following national counts exclude the water fringe: Canada, 10223412 pixels changed (6.44%); Mexico, 141142 pixels changed (0.45%), and U.S., 6878656 pixels changed (4.54%). The countries worked together to produce a definitive list of land cover classifications for the 2005 data; this document is available for download from the same site as the data and is entitled: North American Land Cover Classifications
            (2005). Version 1 of the 2005 North American Land Cover data set was produced as part of the North American Land Change Monitoring System (NALCMS), a trilateral effort between the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing, the United States Geological Survey, and three Mexican organizations including the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (Instituto Nacional de Estadistica y Geografia), National Commission for the Knowledge and Use of the Biodiversity (Comisión Nacional Para el
            Conocimiento y Uso de la Biodiversidad) and the National Forestry Commission of Mexico (Comisión Nacional Forestal). The collaboration is facilitated by the Commission for Environmental Cooperation, an international organization created by the Canada, Mexico, and United States governments under the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation to promote environmental collaboration between the three countries. The general objective of NALCMS is to devise, through collective
            effort, a harmonized multi-scale land cover monitoring approach which ensures high accuracy and consistency in monitoring land cover changes at the North American scale and which meets each country&#x92;s specific requirements. The data set of 2005 Land Cover of North America at a resolution of 250 meters is the first step toward this goal. The initial data set used to generate land cover information over North America was produced by the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing from
            observations acquired by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS/Terra). All seven land spectral bands were processed from Level 1 granules into top-of-atmosphere reflectance covering North America at a 250-meter spatial and 10-day temporal resolution. In order to generate a seamless and consistent land cover map of North America, national maps were generated for Canada by the CCRS; for Mexico by INEGI, CONABIO, and CONAFOR; and for the United States by the USGS.
            Each country used specific training data and land cover mapping methodologies to create national data sets. This North America data set was produced by combining the national land cover data sets.</abstract>
         <purpose>Information on land cover across North America provided by this data set is valuable for a range of audiences, including international organizations such as the United Nations Environment Programme, nongovernmental conservation organizations, land managers, and scientific researchers. The continental scale land cover data generated under NALCMS can be used to address issues such as climate change, carbon sequestration, biodiversity loss, and changes in ecosystem structure and
            function, by helping users to better understand the dynamics and continental-scale patterns of North America&#x92;s changing environment. The North American Atlas data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national and continental level. These data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:10,000,000-scale data. No responsibility is assumed by Natural Resources Canada, Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía, the U.S. Geological Survey, or
            the Commission for Environmental Cooperation in the use of these data.</purpose>

         <attraccr>Canada: An accuracy assessment was performed on the Canadian data at the 12-class IGBP level. To assist in tree life-form identification where crown shape was difficult to interpret, reference data were obtained through visual assessment of high- resolution image data in Google Earth, supported by Landsat data. Within the high- resolution imagery, random sampling was used to generate 838 reference samples. Each sample was interpreted and assigned a primary label, a secondary
            label and a confidence level. The primary label referred to the most likely class assigned to a pixel according to the interpreter, while the secondary label referred to a second class that could also be considered acceptable in cases where ambiguity existed in the interpretation or where more than one label could be deemed correct. Examples of the latter occurred mainly along transition zones where two classes occurred almost equally within a 250m pixel. The confidence level was
            assigned based on the ease with which the land cover was visually interpreted and on the number of classes present in the 250m pixel. A high confidence was assigned to pixels where the high-resolution Google Earth image was acquired at an appropriate time of year for the class in question (for example, summer to fall for deciduous), and where one class clearly dominated the land cover within the pixel. For the primary label only, overall accuracy was nearly 59% with a Kappa of 0.54.
            Overall accuracy increased to 69% and the Kappa increased to 0.65 when considering either the primary or secondary label as being correct. For primary labels interpreted with high confidence, representing 365 of 838 reference samples, overall accuracy increased again to 75% with a Kappa of 0.72. The increase in classification accuracy with high reference-data interpretation confidence was a function of greater land cover homogeneity within the reference data footprint and less
            ambiguity largely due to reference image quality. The analysis of the classification error matrix revealed known sources of spectral confusion among land cover classes. Adjacent forest classes tended to be confused, as well as deciduous forest, shrubland, shrub-covered wetlands, and certain croplands. These classes were difficult to separate with spectral data alone, due to all classes being primary broadleaved deciduous and the known radiometric saturation at leaf area index levels
            in the range of 3-5, which was achieved in all three classes. Other issues arose with the herbaceous class, which was either conifer (according to reference data along the treeline) consisting of open treed areas with herbaceous understory, or low biomass croplands. Confusion between herb, shrub, and deciduous was also due to relatively small disturbance patch sizes of cuts, primarily in British Columbia, and the point-spread function of the sensor, leading to reduced detection of
            objects smaller than seven pixels. Finally, the lichen/moss class was either herbaceous or wetland according to the reference data, due to the prevalence of both lichen and moss in certain wetlands and the low biomass of both the lichen/moss and herbaceous classes. A theoretical analysis of accuracy assessment of global land cover products over Canada in Latifovic and Olthof (2004) examined accuracy as a function of land cover homogeneity and thematic resolution. Based on land cover
            homogeneity in Canada, determined from a representative sample of medium resolution (~30m) land cover products, it was determined that a theoretical accuracy of 70-75% at a 16-land- cover-class thematic level should be achievable depending on the degree of labeling error. Accuracy for the 2005 Canadian land cover data is slightly lower when considering only the primary reference label and is in the 70% range when considering the primary or secondary label. This
            lower-than-theoretically- achievable accuracy is due to errors in the reference data labels as is evident from the increase in accuracy when both labels are considered. When labeling error is reduced further by considering only reference data that were interpreted with 100% confidence, the accuracy climbs to 75%. While this is on the upper range of the theoretically achievable accuracy, indicating minimal to no labeling error, it should be noted that the current assessment was done
            at a 12-class thematic level, which should increase the achievable accuracy and suggests that some labeling error is still present in the data set. Mexico: No formal accuracy assessment has been performed on the Mexican data, however, land cover proportions and distributions agree well with independent land cover and land use estimations of the &#x93;Mapa de Vegetación y Uso de Suelo&#x94;, Serie III of 2007 by INEGI. USA: No formal accuracy assessment has been performed for data
            products in the United States and this land cover data set should be considered provisional until a formal accuracy assessment is conducted.   During processing, the regression tree algorithm employed for land cover classification offers a cross-validation option for assessing classification and prediction reliability.  Cross-validation provides relatively reliable estimates for land cover model performance if the reference data used for cross-validation are collected based on a
            statistically valid sampling design.  The cross-validation values for each zone were used to guide refinements to model training data and to improve classification results.  The quantitative value reported describes an average cross-validation value across several mapped zones and is not implied as a formal indicator of product accuracy.</attraccr>

            <procdesc>A series of monthly MODIS composites were produced prior to the compilation of land cover data for each country. Input data used in land cover mapping were generated from the following original Level 1B MODIS data (collection 5): a) MOD02QKM - Level 1B 250m swath data, 5-min Granules; b) MOD02HKM - Level 1B 500m swath data, 5-min granules; c) MOD03 &#x96; Level 1 Geolocation information, 1km swath data, 5-min granules. All input data are available from the NASA Level 1 and
               Atmosphere Archive and Distribution System (LAADS), http://ladsweb.nascom.nasa.gov/ The MODIS 500m land channels (B3-B7) were downscaled to 250m spatial resolution as described by Trishchenko et al. (2006) and then re-projected into Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area projection using software developed at the CCRS (Khlopenkov et al., 2008). Two original 250m MODIS channels and five downscaled 250m MODIS land channels were assembled into North-America-wide 1 10-day composites following
               the methods developed in Luo et al., (2008). MODIS 10-day composites were further processed to reduce data noise due to different viewing conditions and remaining cloud and atmosphere contamination. A temporal rank filter was applied, calculated as the maximum of minimum values for two overlapping moving windows. For this implementation, a window size of three ten-day composites was used with one pixel overlap between windows. After rank filtering, a procedure to detect residual
               spikes in the data was applied based on a neighbourhood comparison. Within a moving window of 3 composites, if the neighbouring pixels were both above or below the centre pixel by 25%, the centre pixel was linearly interpolated from its neighbours. The filtered 10-day composites were averaged to generate monthly composites. The processed data set contained 12 monthly composites of channels 1 (B1, VIS) and 2 (B2, near-infrared NIR) at 250m spatial resolution and five channels
               designed for land applications (bands B3 to B7) resampled to 250m spatial resolution.</procdesc>

            <procdesc>Canadian land cover was generated following the procedure described in Latifovic et al. (2004) which combines the Enhanced Classification Method (ECM, Beaubien et al., 1999) and Classification by Progressive Generalization (CPG, Cihlar et al., 1998 and Latifovic et al., 1999). The principal characteristic of this classification approach is the preservation of image information and incorporation of human contextual reasoning for land cover labeling. It includes the following
               generalization steps: 1) initial clustering, 2) cluster agglomeration based on spectral similarity and cluster size , 3) cluster agglomeration based on thematic similarity, and 4) cluster labeling. Initial clusters were generated using the K-mean classifier with bands 1, 2, and 6 from a 2005 summer composite created by averaging composites for July and August. Several ancillary GIS layers and other land cover products over regions of Canada were consulted to refine and improve
               land cover labeling.</procdesc>

            <procdesc>For Mexico, the monthly composites of MODIS-Terra top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) surface radiance data for the first seven spectral bands and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were employed for the land cover classification process. For each spectral band and the NDVI, the mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and range between minimum and maximum were computed over the year, half-year, four-month, and quarter-year periods. This resulted in 400 metrics
               derived from MODIS data. In addition, ancillary data were employed including a digital elevation model and derivatives such as slope and aspect, mean, maximum and minimum temperature; total of precipitation and days with precipitation; and the number of green days. Sample data were derived from various sources, including data of the Mexican Forest Inventory, detailed cropland data, urban cover, and additional digitized points from reference sources; 20% of the samples were
               exclusively used for validation. The land cover type identification was achieved using a Decision Tree Classifier (DTC). C5.0 classification trees were generated for the training data. Because exclusively continuous variables were employed, the tree only contains binary splits. Boosting with ten iterations was employed. The trees were applied to the data and the confidences were computed which were used as weights for combining the individual classifications. Several
               classifications were generated based on combinations of 1) input data - monthly TOA reflectances, generated metrics and ancillary data; and 2) complete or subset data sets of training data. Visual and statistical assessments were carried out to obtain the final classification. A distance layer was generated based on an ecoregions map to combine results of the different classifications; only selected classifications were selected for regions where they performed better visually and
               statically. Finally, a water mask was superimposed; the mask was derived from the &#x93;Mapa de Uso de Suelo y Vegetacion&#x94; from INEGI.</procdesc>

            <procdesc>United States classification was achieved by use of a classification and decision tree method (DT) using a combination of Landsat imagery and ancillary data (DEM). The specific DT program employed is called C5, which implements a gain ratio criterion in tree development and pruning (Quinlan, 1993). C5 also implemented several advanced features that can aid and improve land cover classification, including boosting and cross-validation. Boosting is a technique for improving
               classification accuracy, while cross-validation can provide a certain level of estimation regarding the land cover classification quality. In addition, C5 can generate a confidence estimate for each classified pixel and record the associated classification logic in a text file that can be readily interpreted and incorporated into a metadata system. To conduct the land cover classification using DT, a large quantity of training data was required. For North America mapping ,
               training data were collected from several combined sources including NLCD 2001 land cover, GAP land cover, NOAA Coastal Change and Analysis land cover, LANDFIRE land cover and other data sources. Following the development of the best classification through decision tree modeling, additional steps (described in an unpublished technical document; see the USGS point of contact if additional information is needed) were required to complete the final land cover product. Finally, visual
               inspection of the classification was made with areas/pixels that were wrongly classified delineated first as an "area of interest" (AOI); subsequently, limited manual editing was done to eliminate the classification error within the AOI.</procdesc>

            <procdesc>In Version 1 of the 2005 Land Cover data there were three classes that were incorrectly classified in Mexico: urban, water, and cropland. Urban area misclassifications included both areas where the extent was overestimated (e.g. the state of Puebla) and areas where the extent was underestimated (mainly in northern Mexico.) Areas that were mis-estimated were assigned to the most appropriate land cover class by visual interpretation; Google Earth was used for verification and
               visual analysis. Most water misclassifications were underestimations. It was important to correct this problem to allow for accurate change detection between this and later data sets. The waterbodies were identified on MODIS imagery and both size and shape of the areas was corrected. In addition, waterbodies that were not previously mapped were digitized where appropriate. A few waterbodies were reduced in size or eliminated but this was rare. For waterbodies that experience
               fluctuating water levels due to seasonal rains or to water storage and release in artificial lakes, the highest water mark, as indicated by the post-rainy season image (October), was used to map the waterbody size and shape. There were two problems with the classification of cropland. First, the definition of the cropland class is very broad and includes extensive rangeland and extensive agriculture. Second, in the Gulf Coast region cropland is spatially overestimated, but because
               the actual spatial patterns cannot be mapped from MODIS images, correction is difficult. As a result, cropland classifications were not modified in the version 2.</procdesc>

            <procdesc>In Version 1 of the 2005 Land Cover data, Alaska was not correctly aligned with the MODIS source data. A new version of the land cover for Alaska was produced to fix the alignment problem. The land cover was remodeled using properly aligned imagery and new training data for the model. Some small areas in the extreme north and south of Alaska were missing data and these areas were added from cross-walked 2001 NLCD data and the MODIS 2010 data (it was assumed that there were
               land cover changes in these areas between 2005 and 2010.) The land cover information for the conterminous United States was adjusted for more accurate classification. In particular, an effort was made to improve the mapping of areas affected by fire, using the MTBS data. Burned areas were reclassified as necessary, based on the length of time since the fire occurred. Shrub areas in the southwestern U.S. which had the wrong Level II class (Class 8 instead of Class 7) were
               adjusted.</procdesc>

            <procdesc>Since the development of the Version 1 data for Canada, further quality assessment and input from users suggested modifications in some areas. The original source data were re-analyzed; major changes included reduction of treed wetland along the western and eastern coasts, correction of water/shadow confusion in regions of complex terrain, correction of snow/water confusion in the far north, improved disturbance representation based on change detection (Guindon et al.,
               2011), improved forest mapping in the prairies region, some minor changes to urban areas, and some local improvements to wetland mapping.</procdesc>
