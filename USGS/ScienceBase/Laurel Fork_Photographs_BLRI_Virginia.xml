      <abstract>This dataset contains photographs keyed to station points along the Blue Ridge Parkway in Virginia. Photographs are titled and arranged by 7.5-minute quadrangle, and station points are located in the "Detailed geologic mapping geodatabase for the Blue Ridge Parkway in Virginia." The first part of the photograph's filename corresponds to the FieldID attribute of the PhotoPoints entity in the Blue Ridge Parkway Geodatabase. The photographs in this collection are for the Laurel Fork quadrangle, but are also part of a larger data release (Carter et al., 2016). For Laurel Fork, there are 5 jpg in the collection.
