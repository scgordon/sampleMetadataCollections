Both resting isothermal atmosphere and modelgenerated atmosphere with realistic stratification and circulation features were considered. Shallow water tsunami model was run in two different configurations: ocean of equal depth
of 4 km and ocean with realistic continents and bottom topography. Amplitude and timing of atmospheric response is analyzed as a function of vertical stratification and configuration of atmospheric jets. This approach has a potential for early tsunami detection by measuring changes in electric properties of the upper atmosphere in response to acoustic-gravity waves generated by tsunami.</dcterms:abstract><dcterms:spatial xsi:type="dcterms:Box">northlimit=90; southlimit=-90; eastlimit=180; westlimit=100</dcterms:spatial><dcterms:temporal>Begin ; End </dcterms:temporal></onedcx:dcTerms></onedcx:metadata>
