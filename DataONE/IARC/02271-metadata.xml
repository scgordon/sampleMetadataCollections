New snow algorism techniques of remote sensing for snow depth and snow-melting area can be carried out using these in-situ data. We have conducted snow survey from 2006 to now, which is mainly on March and occasionally on January and April/May when seasonal snow melts. The sites are located at an interval of ca. 32-km along the Dalton Highway (Fig. 1). Snow density, snow depth and temperature were measured in snow-pit wall observation at each site. Snow water equivalent (SWE) was calculated by multiplying snow-column snow density by snow depth. As the results, the response of SWE to snow depth showed a positively linear relationship (R2 &gt; 0.90).</dcterms:abstract><dcterms:accessRights>copyright</dcterms:accessRights><dcterms:spatial xsi:type="dcterms:Box">northlimit=75; southlimit=50; eastlimit=-130; westlimit=-180</dcterms:spatial><dcterms:temporal>Begin 2006-01-01T15:24:00; End 2015-04-02T15:24:00</dcterms:temporal></onedcx:dcTerms></onedcx:metadata>
