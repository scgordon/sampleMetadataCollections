Location description: combination name that includes the site + area or transect&amp;#xD;
Object: core collection equipment that was used to collect the core &amp;#xD;
Object_ID: core label used in field notebooks during the time of sampling&amp;#xD;
Easting, Northing: recorded in latitude/longitude using a hand-held GPS, later transformed into Easting and Northing using ArcINFO software. Coordinate system is Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Zone 4. Horizontal datum as NAD83, vertical datum is NAVD88 using GEOID09. &amp;#xD;
Latitude, Longitude: recorded using a hand-held GPS in WGS84. &amp;#xD;

Contact: investigator's email address&amp;#xD;
Co-Investigator: core collector and custodian; contact regarding the core at its' stored location &amp;#xD;
Co-I Contact: co-investigator's email  &amp;#xD;
Last Update: date of the most recent update to spreadsheet&amp;#xD;
Processed core name: name used in publication&amp;#xD;
Collection data: date of core collection&amp;#xD;

Polygon type: description of the type of polygon sampled. High-centered polygon (HCP), low-centered polygon (LCP), transitional polygon (trans poly), unknown &amp;#xD;
Polygon feature: description of the part of the polygon that was sampled. Center, rim, or trough&amp;#xD;
Drilled by: name of the lab/university that collected the core &amp;#xD;
Storage location:  name of the lab/university where core is being stored&amp;#xD;
Collection type: status of the core during collection. Frozen, thawed, or mixed. &amp;#xD;
Core collection protocols: protocols that describe the steps or methods for the collection of the core&amp;#xD;
Subsampled: indicates if the core has been processed or cut. Yes or no. &amp;#xD;
GPS waypoint name: name that the core was given in hand-held GPS unit&amp;#xD;
DGPS elevation: elevation as determined by dGPS&amp;#xD;

Core length: core length as measured in the field [cm]&amp;#xD;
Core length lab: core length as measured in the lab [cm]&amp;#xD;
Thaw depth: measured thaw depth near core [cm] &amp;#xD;
Thaw depth date: date thaw depth recorded. Estimated date is specific date is not available. &amp;#xD;
Thaw depth technique: technique used to measure thaw depth (e.g. tile probe)&amp;#xD;
Photo: indicates if there are photographs of the core. No value = unknown&amp;#xD;
CT scan: indicates if there are CT scans of the core. No value = unknown&amp;#xD;
Physical properties: physical properties analyses including bulk density, gravimetric water content, sample weight, sample volume, dry weight, skeleton density, thermal conductivity, organic fraction, loss on ignition (LOI), mineral fraction, texture, ice content, cryostructure description.
